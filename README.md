# MASM
My objective now is try to replicate the TPE that i made previously and a couple of more things BUT in c++, 
it will still be accessible from python since i will use the c python api to be able to have the speed of c++ but the flexibility of python, 
in order to do that i need to create a linear algebra library similar to numpy, 
i want this library to be fast so i wanted to understand Assembly to be able to program better in c++ and also to understand better how the cpu registers works 
and how SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) works, 
so i started in masm with this like a three weeks ago, it is not too much but with all the hours of masm tutorials i think i know enough how to code using simd.
This is basically a random number generator, it receives as parameters a seed and the number of random numbers that are desired.
